# Universal-Bot
The all-new open source Discord bot.

# Purpose
This was originally a project for a friend, but I have much larger plans for it. This all-purpose discord bot's features include: Moderation, and entertainment.
I try to add a new command every day, and collaboration is appreciated. It is in beta, and will be updated often.

# Commands
Here is a updated list of all of the bots commands:

!ping -Responds with pong.

!test -Reponds with testing.

!ban [Member] -Bans a user.
example: !ban @DINO IS COOL
You have to add the: @, or else it won't work.

!kick [Member] -Kicks a user.
example: !kick @DINO IS COOL
You have to add the: @, or else it won't work.

!info -Gives info about the server. (Date it was made, owner, and Server Id.)

!report [Bug/Feature] -Allows you to report bugs, or suggest features.
example: !report When you say blah blah blah, the bot goes offline.

!coinflip -Chooses random from heads, and tails.

!help -Tells you all the commands.

!changenick [User] [Nickname] -Changes the nickname of said user.
example: !changenick @User DINO
It changes the mentioned user's name to the text to the right of the mention. (In this case it changes @User's nickname to DINO.)
Keep in mind, the user: @User is STILL @User. They just display as DINO now. To change their name again, you still use @User, EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS THEY ARE @DINO.

!joke -Chooses a random joke from a list.

!jokerep [Joke] -Adds a joke to the joke list

!setdelay [Time in seconds] -Sets the slowmode of a channel. Setting it to 0 turns slowmode off.

!wikisearch [Search term] -Searches wikipedia, and gives you a response.

These are all of the current commands as of now. This github page is regularly updated, as new updates get added.

# In-Development Commands/Features
Commands, and features that I am currently working on.

!rps [Rock/Paper/Scissors] -A simple rock paper scissors command, where the bot randomly chooses rock/paper/scissors, and decides who wins.

!pokesearch [Pokemon] -A command that tells you more about a specific Pokemon.

-Improved ban command. It will dm the banned user, sends them an invite link if they get unbanned, and why they were banned.
-A gui for me to control my bot. It would let me change the status, turn off the bot, and let me change the command prefix.
-Music integration for the voice channels.

# Trouble Shooting

Q: Ban, Kick, and Changenick doesn't work.
A: Does the bot have Admin/mod? If not, take the Universal Bot role, and drag the role to the second top, and the admin role to the very top. That will stop it from banning admins, and ensures the proper function.
A2: Does the person trying to use the command have admin?
A3: Is the person @ mentioned?
A4: Is the command word lowercase? Example: !Ban will not work, but !ban will. (Notice the command word is lowercase.)
A5: Check if the bot is online. The bot often goes offline for updates.

Q: Commands do not work in general.
A: Make sure the command is in all lowercase.

Q: How to import the bot?
A: All you need to do is download the code, python, and a good IDE and edit/add away!

Dang, thats alot of words. ;)
