# Universal-Bot
The all-new, open source, Discord bot.

# Purpose
This was originally a project for a friend, but I have much larger plans for it. This all-purpose discord bot's features include: Moderation, and entertainment.
I try to add a new command every day, and collaboration is appreciated. It is in beta, and will be updated often.

# Commands
Here is a updated list of all of the bots commands:

/ping -Responds with pong.

/test -Reponds with testing.

/ban -Bans a user.
example: /ban @DINO IS COOL
You have to add the: @, or else it won't work.

/kick -Kicks a user.
example: /kick @DINO IS COOL
You have to add the: @, or else it won't work.

/info -Gives info about the server. (Date it was made, owner, and Server Id.)

/report -Allows you to report bugs, or suggest features.
example: /report When you say blah blah blah, the bot goes offline.

/coinflip -Chooses random from heads, and tails.

/helpme -Tells you all the commands.

/changenick -Changes the nickname of said user.
example: /changenick @User DINO
It changes the mentioned user's name to the text to the right of the mention. (In this case it changes @User's nickname to DINO.)
Keep in mind, the user: @User is STILL @User. They just display as DINO now. To change their name again, you still use @User, EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS THEY ARE @DINO.

These are all of the current commands as of now. This github page is regularly updated, as new updates get added.

# Trouble Shooting

Q: Ban, Kick, and Changenick doesn't work.
A: Does the bot have Admin/mod? If not, take the Universal Bot role, and drag the role to the second top, and the admin role to the very top. That will stop it from banning admins, and ensures the proper function.
A2: Does the person trying to use the command have admin?
A3: Is the person @ mentioned?
A4: Is the command word lowercase? Example: /Ban will not work, but /ban will. (Notice the command word is lowercase.)
A5: Check if the bot is online. The bot often goes offline for updates.

Q: Commands do not work in general.
A: Make sure the command is in all lowercase.

Q: How to import the bot?
A: The bot's code is not currently public. YET. However, the bot is available for use.

Dang, thats alot of words. ;)

# Suggestions

Your help is appreciated.

# What you can do with MY code

Feel free to reuse the bot, under some conditions.
You just have to give credit!
